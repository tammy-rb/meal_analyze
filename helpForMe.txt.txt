Steps in Order:

Open PowerShell as administrator.
Run: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
Run: .\venv\Scripts\activate
You should now see (venv) at the beginning of your prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.
When you are done, run deactivate
Then, if you changed the execution policy, and wish to revert it, run Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser
